# Starmap with real data

This is the current skymap based on your country you specified (english name or iso code) or use lat/lon coords. I wrote this in js with data from hipparcos main catalog.

I removed the helper scripts and data from the steam publication, because its just to get data like stars.js and countries.js.

The Wallpaper works perfekt with the wallpaper engine(Windows), but you can use it also with Plash(Mac / default location is Berlin).
