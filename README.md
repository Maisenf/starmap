# Starmap with real data

This is the current skymap based on your country you specified (english name or iso code) or use lat/lon coords. I wrote this in js with data from hipparcos main catalog.

I removed the helper scripts and data from the steam publication, because its just to get data like stars.js and countries.js. You dont need to run the helper, but u could to retrive more stars, edit the querry_brieghtest_stars.py therefor.

The Wallpaper works perfekt with the wallpaper engine(Windows), but you can use it also with Plash(Mac / default location is Berlin).
